To compile this program using the g++ compiler, make sure all files are in 
the same directory and enter the following command on the terminal while
in that directory:

g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp Student.cpp Roster.cpp -o main

The -std=c++11 is needed to make sure the compiler doesn't use an old
a version of C++ and is necessary to make sure the code works properly

When you are ready to run the program, enter the following command on the
terminal after compiling:

./main

That's it. Enjoy!
